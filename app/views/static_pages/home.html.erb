        <h5 class="center">Satisfaction through the roof</h5>
        <p class="light">Our flat fee model does away with wait times and co-pays, aligns incentives between doctors and patients, 
        and gives you unlimited access to a primary care physician when you need it.</p>
        <p class="light">With no need to go through insurance, you can chat with your doctor in the way that works for you, whether 
        in-person, by phone, text, or email. Our physicians do not have "referral quotas" for specialist appointments. We make sure decisions 
        are based on your health, not on a hospital's bottom line.</p>

        <h5 class="center">Better managed conditions</h5>
        <p class="light">On average, >50% of employer healthcare costs are driven by  less than 5% of employees. 
        Unmanaged chronic conditions drive expensive, episodic events including emergency room visits and 
        overnight hospital stays.</p>
        <p class="light">Direct primary care patients spend more time with a doctor who truly knows them, driving increased 
        engagement and better management of the patients' health.Union County, NC saved $1.28m on healthcare costs (or $121 per 
        covered life per month) over just 12 months when they switched to direct primary care.</p>

        <h5 class="center">Increased productivity</h5>
        <p class="light">The average wait time to see a primary care doctor is 24 days. This leads to more sick days and unhappy employees. 
        Because we're able to offer same day appointments to >90% of those who request it, we minimize time off and keep your employees 
        fighting fit.</p>
        <p class="light">Approximately 25% of Americans do not even have a primary care doctor. This leads to poorer health and more nasty 
        surprises. We make sure every employee is paired with an experienced doctor who will help to proactively manage health and identify 
        issues early on.</p>
